[section:scheduling Scheduling]

Fibers are managed by a scheduler which coordinates the sequence of fibers
running or waiting.
Each thread is required to have its own scheduler. By default, __boost_fiber__
allocates for each thread a scheduler ([class_link round_robin]) (on the
heap).
To prevent the library from heap-allocating a default scheduler for a given
thread, that thread must call [function_link set_scheduling_algorithm] before
any other __boost_fiber__ entry point.

        void thread_fn()
        {
            my_fiber_scheduler mfs;
            boost::fibers::set_scheduling_algorithm( & mfs);
            ...
        }

A fiber-scheduler must implement interface __algo__. __boost_fiber__ provides two
schedulers: [class_link round_robin] and [class_link round_robin_ws].

You are explicitly permitted to code your own __algo__ subclass, and to pass
it to [function_link set_scheduling_algorithm].

[member_heading algorithm..spawn]

        virtual void spawn( detail::fiber_base::ptr_t const& f) = 0;

[variablelist
[[Effects:] [Spawns fiber `f`, e.g. `f` will be entered the first time
or resumed where it was suspended before. Suspends the current fiber.]]
]

[member_heading algorithm..priority]

        virtual void priority( detail::fiber_base::ptr_t const& f, int p) noexcept = 0;

[variablelist
[[Effects:] [Sets priority `p` for fiber `f`. Interpretation of "priority"
is entirely up to the subclass.]]
[[Throws:] [Nothing]]
]

[member_heading algorithm..join]

        virtual void join( detail::fiber_base::ptr_t const& f) = 0;

[variablelist
[[Effects:] [Suspends the current fiber until fiber `f` terminates.]]
]

[member_heading algorithm..active]

        virtual detail::fiber_base::ptr_t active() noexcept = 0;

[variablelist
[[Returns:] [The active fiber, or a null-pointer if the current
execution context is not a fiber managed by this __algo__ instance.]]
[[Note:] [While the initial context for a given thread is conceptually also a
fiber, it has no associated `detail::fiber_base` instance. This is when
`active()` returns null. Higher-level __boost_fiber__ operations treat a
thread's initial context as equivalent to an explicitly-launched fiber, but
this method operates below that level of abstraction.]]
[[See also:] [[member_link algorithm..get_main_id]]]
]

[member_heading algorithm..run]

        virtual bool run() = 0;

[variablelist
[[Effects:] [Selects one fiber in ready state and runs it until it suspends.
The choice of fiber is up to the subclass instance.]]
[[Returns:] [Returns `true` if one fiber was ready and successfully executed, `false`
otherwise.]]
]

[member_heading algorithm..wait]

        virtual void wait( unique_lock< detail::spinlock > & lk) = 0;

[variablelist
[[Precondition:] [`lk` is locked by the current fiber. It locks the spinlock
protecting the internal state of a mutex or condition_variable.]]
[[Effects:] [Current fiber is set to waiting-state and gets suspended.]]
[[Postcondition:] [`lk` is unlocked.]]
]

[member_heading algorithm..wait_until]

        virtual bool wait_until( clock_type::time_point const& timeout_time,
                                 unique_lock< detail::spinlock > & lk) = 0;

[variablelist
[[Precondition:] [`lk` is locked by the current fiber. It locks the spinlock
protecting the internal state of a mutex or condition_variable.]]
[[Effects:] [Current fiber is set to waiting-state and gets suspended.]]
[[Returns:] [Returns `true` if fiber was resumed before time-point
`timeout_time` was reached, `false` otherwise.]]
[[Postcondition:] [`lk` is unlocked.]]
]

[member_heading algorithm..wait_for]

        template< typename Rep, typename Period >
        bool wait_for( chrono::duration< Rep, Period > const& timeout_duration,
                       unique_lock< detail::spinlock > & lk)

[variablelist
[[Precondition:] [`lk` is locked by the current fiber. It locks the spinlock
protecting the internal state of a mutex or condition_variable.]]
[[Effects:] [Current fiber is set to waiting-state and gets suspended.]]
[[Returns:] [Returns `true` if fiber was resumed before time-duration
`timeout_duration` has passed, `false` otherwise.]]
[[Postcondition:] [`lk` is unlocked.]]
]

[member_heading algorithm..yield]

        virtual void yield() = 0;

[variablelist
[[Effects:] [Suspends active fiber without waiting; that is, the current fiber
is immediately set to ready-state.]]
]

[member_heading algorithm..get_main_id]

        virtual detail::fiber_base::id get_main_id() = 0;

[variablelist
[[Returns:] [A `fiber_base::id` associated with the initial context of the
thread on which the scheduler is running.]]
[[Note:] [While the initial context for a given thread is conceptually also a
fiber, it has no associated `detail::fiber_base` instance. Higher-level
__boost_fiber__ operations treat a thread's initial context as equivalent to
an explicitly-launched fiber, but this method operates below that level of
abstraction.]]

[class_heading round_robin]

This class implements __algo__ and schedules fibers in round-robin fashion.

[class_heading round_robin_ws]

`round_robin_ws` is intended to be used for migrating fibers between threads (different
schedulers). For this purpose the class has two additional functions - `steal_from()` and
`migrate_to()`.
This functionality can be used to implement work-stealing/-sharing in a threadpool.

        // steal a fiber from a scheduler `other_ds` running in another thread
        boost::fibers::fiber f( other_ds->steal_from() );

        // check if stealing was successful
        if ( f)
        {
            // migrate stolen fiber to scheduler running in this thread
            ds.migrate_to( f);

            // detach fiber
            f.detach();
        }
