[section:performance Performance]

Performance measurements were taken using `std::chrono::highresolution_clock`,
with overhead corrections.
The code was compiled using the build options:
variant = release, optimization = speed
[footnote Intel Core2 Q6700, x86_64, 3GHz].

The columns labeled [*fiber (atomics)] were compiled with default fiber
synchronization, capable of synchronizing fibers running on different threads.
The columns labeled [*fiber (raw)] were compiled with [link cross_thread_sync
`BOOST_FIBERS_NO_ATOMICS`].

[note The measurement of fibers include the memory allocation of fiber stacks!]
